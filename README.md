# emergent-enterprise
A LangChain framework evolving organizational intelligence through hierarchically structured autonomous agents, backed by graph-based strategy analysis

Emergent Enterprise executes user-defined projects while evolving its organizational capabilities. It operates through a fractal pattern of autonomous AI agents, each driven by a unique persona. A master agent, shaped by visionary leadership traits and optimizing for both project and long-term success, initiates the system. The framework unfolds through recursive autonomy - each agent crafts strategies, spawns sub-agents, and assigns tasks within resource constraints.

All decisions, actions, and outcomes are captured in a shared graph database, with unexpected results weighted more heavily. These experiences distill into organizational learnings, accessible to all agents. Through continuous execution, measurement, and adaptation, the organization evolves increasingly effective strategies across all time scales.
